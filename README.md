# utilizingpychain

#in the warm up to blockchain  , we will be running a blockchain ledger, using the streamlit lib. in the exercise there are objectives to run the chain with a number of diffuclties to obtain the porper hash. In the code in it's entiretiy the assignment is to understand the nature of decenteralized monitary blockchains /ledgers(i.e blockchain).

by creating a instance the "genisis block" on a local mempool (which isn't on this exercise), which initalizes a new block which in the warmup we can validate it's transactions in the code.
